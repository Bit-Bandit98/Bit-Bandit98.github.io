<h2> Projects </h2>
<p> Here are some cool stuff I've worked on over the years. From physics and path-finding demos to a zombie shooter and a physics puzzler. </p>

<h2 class="ProjectTitle"> Game - Dogma </h2>

<p class="ProjectDescription"> Now this is probably the biggest game on here.
This game was the result of hard work of a talented artist named Rachael Jenner, and myself as programmer for our final major project of uni.
This game is based on Cold War era ideological warfare; you choose 1 of 5 fictitious ideologies, and it is your goal to spread said ideology all over the world.
It's a very complex game with complex mechanics, so if you want to see how the game works I'd watch the attached video. There's a lot to the game!
The game was a great success in terms of appeal at uni, and definitely gave us some insight on how to make the next project even better. If you want to play, here's the link<br>https://bitbandit98.itch.io/dogma
<br>Give it a play!  </p>

<h2 class="ProjectTitle"> Game - Planet Jumper </h2>

<p class="ProjectDescription"> You know Cookie Clicker? This is like that except without the Arthritis, and in space. The goal is to get to the next planet, and the time it takes to get to said planet varies on your speed. It can range from just 5 (real time)minutes to 2 (very real) millennia. If you don't feel like passing your save progress down to future generations, you can get money to upgrade your speed, which will drastically cut down the time required to reach the next planet. You can also upgrade facilities that increase your money multiplayer, add passive money on a per second basis, and even automatic turrets.  
Oh and there are big numbers too, like really really big numbers, which is what people love these days. If you wanna check it out, heres a link <br> https://bitbandit98.itch.io/planet-jumper <br> Give it a play! </p>

<h2 class="ProjectTitle"> Game - Horde Slayer </h2>
<iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3hK0jenKrM"

<p class="ProjectDescription"> A zombie shooter made as an assignment project in an Advanced Programming course. The game - while simple in concept - was actually pretty hard to create. I had to learn some crazy Mathematical mumbo jumbo involving Vector cross products to get stuff like having the character play a different running animation in relation to where he is facing. 
Basically, if the character walks up but is facing right, he'll play an animation of him walking right. This creates a true sense of 8 directional movement, which I think is pretty cool.
Oh yeah and you kill zombies too, you have powerups, two different guns, bullet penetration, yadi yadi yada.
Anyway it was an awesome project to work on, if you want to play it, here is a link <br>https://bitbandit98.itch.io/horde-slayer<br> Give it a play! </p>

<h2 class="ProjectTitle"> Game - Stasis </h2>

<p class="ProjectDescription"> A physics puzzle game that was made for an 
assessment in a games programming class. The game has you do some cool stuff 
like pause objects and animations in order to solve puzzles. The game required understanding the way
 the Unity physics system behaves and some vector mathematics. It was a very educational experience, with the added benefit of being a neat little puzzle game. Give it a watch! </p>

<section class="Video" class="Responsive"> 
<h2 class="ProjectTitle"> Mechanic - Pushing </h2>
<iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSgt6XrytJc"
 title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay;
 clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="ProjectDescription"> Here's a demo that was the precursor for the "Stasis" game. While this demo features all the mechanics found within Stasis, a push mechanic had to be taken out that is present in this demo.

Basically, along with pausing objects in time, you can also push them around. You can charge your pushes to push objects further, and if you pause an object and push it, it will add velocity to said object, in which you can do it as many times as you want. When your mouse inevitably breaks, you can unpause the object and see a "blink and you'll miss it" moment of the object flying across your speed.

This required creative use of Vector mathematics, and understanding how to use that information to correctly predict where the object to move when unpaused, indicated by the trail.

Give it a watch! </p>

<h2 class="ProjectTitle"> Mechanic - Pathfinding </h2>
<iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uNb7lUKEPqc" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; 
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="ProjectDescription"> This is another exercise done through an online course. This one is a bit technical so bear with me.
This game - while not being complete - uses a path-finding algorithm called "Breadth-first search" which is a way for a entity to navigate the world in a reliable manner.
This was a great way to learn other programming features, such as C# lists and classes. While simple in concept, it was relatively difficult, but I've definitely learnt a lot when doing it. 
Give the short demonstration a watch. </p>

<h2 class="ProjectTitle"> Game - Terminal Hacker </h2>
<iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCUAoqITyL0"
 title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;
 autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="ProjectDescription"> This was an exercise from an online course just to be clear. It made me understand the fundamentals of programming in Unity; in a game where you use an old CRT like monitor no less. 
The game has you hack into one of three networks where you'll have to hack into the network by solving an anagram of a word. You have a few guesses before it resets the password and you have to start all over. It was cool in the fact that it that I also had to understand shuffling in order to get the anagram to work in the first place.
Give it a watch hacker person. </p>
