<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> Now this is probably the biggest game on here.
This game was the result of hard work of a talented artist named Rachael Jenner, and myself as programmer for our final major project of uni.
This game is based on Cold War era ideological warfare; you choose 1 of 5 fictitious ideologies, and it is your goal to spread said ideology all over the world.
It's a very complex game with complex mechanics, so if you want to see how the game works I'd watch the attached video. There's a lot to the game!
The game was a great success in terms of appeal at uni, and definitely gave us some insight on how to make the next project even better. </p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
<p> Programming, Game Design, and Sounds.</p>
