<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> Now this is probably the biggest game on here.
This game was the result of hard work of a talented artist named Rachael Jenner, and myself as programmer for a major project.
This game is based on Cold War era ideological warfare; you choose 1 of 5 fictitious ideologies, and it is your goal to spread said ideology all over the world.
It's a very complex game with complex mechanics, so if you want to see how the game works I'd watch the attached video. There's a lot to the game!
Learning to work with another person was very educational, which included us defining our own content creation pipeline. Rachael would do the assets and art, and then give them to me to put in the game itself.
It was also taught me the values of knowing how to pass your data around. A game like this is heavily data driven, and I had to understand how to best pass that data around before I wanted to cry.
The game was a great success in terms of appeal, and definitely gave us some insight on how to make the next project even better. </p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
