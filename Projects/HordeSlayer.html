<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> A zombie shooter made as an exercise in 3D shooting gameplay. The game - while simple in concept - was actually pretty hard to create. I had to learn some crazy Mathematical mumbo jumbo involving Vector cross products to get stuff like having the character play a different running animation in relation to where he is facing. 
Basically, if the character walks north but is facing east, it'll play an animation of them strafing east. This creates a true sense of 8 directional movement, which I think is pretty cool. Math is pretty rad.
Oh yeah and you kill zombies too, you have powerups, two different guns, bullet penetration, and all that cool stuff.
It was an awesome project to work on, and I learnt a lot.</p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
