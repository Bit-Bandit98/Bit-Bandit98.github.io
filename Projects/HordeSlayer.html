<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> A zombie shooter made as an assignment project in an Advanced Programming course. The game - while simple in concept - was actually pretty hard to create. I had to learn some crazy Mathematical mumbo jumbo involving Vector cross products to get stuff like having the character play a different running animation in relation to where he is facing. 
Basically, if the character walks up but is facing right, he'll play an animation of him walking right. This creates a true sense of 8 directional movement, which I think is pretty cool.
Oh yeah and you kill zombies too, you have powerups, two different guns, bullet penetration, yadi yadi yada.
Anyway it was an awesome project to work on, and I learnt a lot.</p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
<p> Programming and Game Design.</p>
