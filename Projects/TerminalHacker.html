<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> This was an exercise from an online course just to be clear. It made me understand the fundamentals of programming in Unity; in a game where you use an old CRT like monitor no less. 
The game has you hack into one of three networks where you'll have to hack into the network by solving an anagram of a word. You have a few guesses before it resets the password and you have to start all over. It was cool in the fact that it that I also had to understand shuffling in order to get the anagram to work in the first place.
Give it a watch, hacker person.</p>
