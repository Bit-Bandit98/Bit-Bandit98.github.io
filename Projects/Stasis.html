<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> A physics puzzle game that was made for an 
assessment in a games programming class. The game has you do some cool stuff 
like pause objects and animations in order to solve puzzles. The game required understanding the way
 the Unity physics system behaves and some vector mathematics. It was a very educational experience, with the added benefit of being a neat little puzzle game. Give it a watch! </p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
<p> Programming, and Game Design.</p>
