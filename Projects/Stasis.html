<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> A physics puzzle game that was made for an 
assessment in a games programming class. The game has you do some cool stuff 
like pause objects and animations in order to solve puzzles. The game required understanding the way
 the Unity physics system behaves and some vector mathematics. As such I had to do some background research, like what the heck a "Vector Magnitude" was. 
 It was a very educational experience, with the added benefit of being a neat little puzzle game.  </p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
<p> Programming, and Game Design.</p>
