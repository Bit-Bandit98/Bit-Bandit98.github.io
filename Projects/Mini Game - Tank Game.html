<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> This was an exercise in using Unreal Engine 5 with C++ based on an online course. This small project was an exercise to get used to the C++ and Unreal 5 workflow. For example, I utilised best practices for C++: creating header classes and implementation classes for tanks and turrets alike. Furthermore I created classes for the purposes of an inheritance base design; turrets and tanks would inherit from a base "Pawn" class to allow for code reusability. After learning how the C++ implementation worked in Unreal Engine, I then made a short game where you as the tank had to eliminate all turrets in the level. It was a fun, and enlightening experience. </p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
