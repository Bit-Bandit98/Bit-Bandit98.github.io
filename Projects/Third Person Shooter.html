<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> This was another project from an online course that I put a spin on. The project was using C++ in conjunction with Unreal Engine 5 to make a third person shooter. From here, I learnt various complex features, such as animation systems, audio mixing, artificial intelligence, raycasting, etc. The goal is pretty simple; just kill everyone. Overall it was an extremely fun project to work on and it brought me further insight in how to make a third person shooter. </p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
<p> Programming.</p>
