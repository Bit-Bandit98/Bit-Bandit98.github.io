<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> You know Cookie Clicker? This is like that, but in spaaaaace! The goal is to get from planet to planet, with the time it takes to get to said planet varies on your speed. It can range from just 5 (real time) minutes to 2 (very real) millennia. If you don't feel like passing your save progress down to future generations, you can get money to upgrade your speed, which will drastically cut down the time required to reach the next planet. You can also upgrade facilities that increase your money multiplyer, add passive money on a per second basis, and even automatic turrets.  
Oh and there are big numbers too, like really really big numbers, which is what people love these days. </p>
<h2> What did I work on? </h2>
