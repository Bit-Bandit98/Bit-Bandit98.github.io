<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> Here's a demo that was the precursor for the "Stasis" game. While this demo features all the mechanics found within Stasis, a push mechanic had to be taken out that is present in this demo.

Basically, along with pausing objects in time, you can also push them around. You can charge your pushes to push objects further, and if you pause an object and push it, it will add velocity to said object, in which you can do it as many times as you want. When your mouse inevitably breaks, you can unpause the object and see a "blink and you'll miss it" moment of the object flying across your speed.

This required creative use of Vector mathematics, and understanding how to use that information to correctly predict where the object to move when unpaused, indicated by the trail.

Give it a watch! </p>
