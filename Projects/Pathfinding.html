<h2> Description </h2>
<p class="ProjectDescription "> This is another exercise done through an online course. This one is a bit technical so bear with me.
This game - while not being complete - uses a path-finding algorithm called "Breadth-first search" which is a way for a entity to navigate the world in a reliable and efficient manner.
This was a great way to learn other programming features, such as C# lists and classes. While simple in concept, it was relatively difficult, but I've definitely learnt a lot when doing it.
It actually kinda opened my eyes on how everything in programming is its own little puzzle, begging you to try and solve it in the most efficient way possible. Programming is cool.  </p>
